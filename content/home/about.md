**Much ado about _processes_ whether Natural or Artificial.**

I am a Postdoctoral researcher in the gravity group at the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton. I am curious about the workings of the Universe from _micro to macro_ scales. How it all began to the eventual fate of massive stars termed *Black holes* .

It turns out you need to *gravitate within the principles of quantum mechanics*. How to achieve this is a big question?

Besides this, I also muse about the Artificial Intelligence and Deep (machine) learning algorithms.
