We are at a stage in fundamental physics where it is imperative to understand the amalgamation of the principles of quantum mechanics with gravitation. It is an ongoing endeavor to answer the questions such as,

* What is the small scale structure of spacetime?
* How do the matter and gravity interact in the quantum picture?
* What leads to the emergence of “classical” reality?
* What are the predictions/effects in any model and how to test them?

There are different approaches to answering these questions in quantum gravity and each comes with its own conundrums. The task is further made daunting by the lack of experimental insight in this field. However, with the tremendous advancement in the last two decades, particularly, in the realm of gathering experimental data and numerical computation, it is possible to get some answers for the above questions provided we “look” for them and their imprints.
